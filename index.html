  <!-- About Me Section -->
  <!-- I didn't add any flex since it's just text -->
  <section id="about">
    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>I like to craft experiences that make people smile. Or at the very least get a little 
        hit of dopamine. I like solving problems to make life a little easier and enjoyable for 
        users. I use Figma, Djay Pro, and other tools to make ideas come to life.
      <br>
      <br>
        With an 8-year career in Human Resources and a BS degree in Psychology, I've 
        dedicated myself to understanding, empathizing, and engaging with people. My 
        work in HR allowed me to hone skills in communication, problem-solving, and 
        human-centered thinking. Meanwhile, my studies in Psychology deepened my 
        insights into human behavior and cognitive processes. This blend of experiences 
        naturally led me to the field of UX design, where I see a profound opportunity to 
        create intuitive and meaningful user experiences. My transition into UX is not just 
        a career change; it's a continuation of my passion for connecting with people and 
        shaping interactions that resonate. Having recently completed a comprehensive 
        UX/UI bootcamp, I am eager to apply my unique blend of skills to design products 
        that are not only functional but also empathetic to user needs.
